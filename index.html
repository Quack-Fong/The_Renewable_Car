The renewable car will be able to run, theoretically, forever since the car will be able to get solar energy from the sun while also storing compressed air from the air around it. This way the car will be able to run on both sources of energy whenever it needs to. It solves the problem of requiring stronger and more expensive solar panels to have cars run longer. Instead you would simply need two inexpensive systems that work together, this resulting in a car that solves both the problems of increasing gas prices as well as pollution. Overall, the renewable car is a revolutionary product that will lead us to a brighter and longer lasting future.</p>
